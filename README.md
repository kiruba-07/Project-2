# HR Analytics to track employee performance
This project leverages Tableau and Python (pandas) to analyze and visualize HR data for tracking employee performance and attrition trends, empowering HR teams to make data-driven decisions for retaining talent and improving productivity.
## Objective:
To analyze and visualize employee performance, attrition, and satisfaction using Tableau, enabling HR and stakeholders to identify key factors influencing employee performance and retention, supporting data-driven workforce strategies.

## My Project - Dashboard
I developed a project to visualize employee performance and attrition insights using interactive dashboards created in Tableau. It includes key metrics such as average performance rating, attrition rates by department and gender, and satisfaction levels, with filters for department, gender, and job role for user-driven exploration.

## Dataset Used

## Process
### Data Collection & Cleaning
Imported the HR Employee Attrition dataset into Tableau.

Removed unnecessary columns to reduce memory.

Ensured correct data types for categorical and numerical fields.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored attrition patterns across departments, gender, and job roles.

Analyzed distributions of performance ratings and satisfaction metrics.

### Feature Engineering
Calculated average performance rating.

Computed attrition rates by department and gender using Tableau calculated fields.

Created KPIs to track key metrics for HR.

## Dashboard Creation in Tableau
Built an interactive HR Analytics dashboard with:

KPI cards (average performance rating, attrition %).

Bar charts for attrition by department and gender.

Scatter plots to explore correlations between tenure, training, job satisfaction, and performance ratings.

Filters for department, gender, and job role for targeted analysis.

## Business Insights
Attrition Trends: Higher attrition in certain departments indicates a need for targeted retention efforts.

Performance Rating: Average rating across the company helps track workforce quality.

Tenure Impact: Employees with lower tenure have higher attrition rates, indicating challenges in initial retention.

Satisfaction Levels: Low satisfaction scores are associated with higher attrition, emphasizing the need for employee engagement strategies.

## Project Insights
* Attrition Rate: Clear visibility into department-wise and gender-wise attrition rates.
* Performance Monitoring: Track average performance rating across departments.
* Employee Satisfaction: Identify departments with low satisfaction scores linked to attrition.
* Tenure and Attrition: Short-tenure employees are more likely to leave, aiding early intervention.
* Interactive Filtering: Enables HR to slice data by department, gender, and job role for focused analysis.

## Conclusion
This project successfully identifies key patterns in employee performance and attrition, supporting HR in making data-driven decisions to improve retention and workforce productivity. The interactive Tableau dashboard enables easy tracking of performance metrics, attrition, and satisfaction across different employee segments, providing a clear, actionable view for HR leadership.
